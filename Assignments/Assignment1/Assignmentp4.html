            <h2>The Spiral Model</h2>
                <p> The piral model combines the idea of iterative development with the systematic,
                controlled aspects of the waterfall model.<br> Spiral model is a combination of iterative
                development process model and sequential linear development model i.e. waterfall model 
                with very high emphasis on risk analysis. the spiral model is favored for large, expensive, 
                and complicated projects. This model uses the same phases as the waterfall model, in pretty much
                the same order, separated by planning, risk assessment, and the building of protoypes and simulations.
                The Spiral model has four phases. They include identification, design, construct or build, and evaluation 
                and risk analysis.<br /></p>
