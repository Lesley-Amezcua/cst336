            <h2>The Waterfall Model</h2>
                <p> The waterfall model is a linear sequential flow.
                <br>With this model progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards
                (like a waterfall) through the phases of software implementation.
                In this specific model phases in the development process begin only
                if the previous phase is complete. The waterfall approach does not
                define the process to go back to the precious phase to handle changes
                in requirement. This was the earliest approach that was used for 
                software development.<br /></p>
